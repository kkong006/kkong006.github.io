This is the source code for my personal website. It contains my skills, contact information, projects and activities.

To make this website, I learned HTML and CSS through Kahn Academy's HTML/CSS course and referred to w3schools and the Mozilla Developer network for additional documentation. I used material icons from Google Design for the navigation menu and Google Fonts for the font styles.
