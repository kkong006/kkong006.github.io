This is the source code for my personal website. It contains my skills, contact information, projects and activities. <br>
To make this website, I learned HTML and CSS through Kahn Academy's HTML/CSS course and referred to w3schools and the Mozilla Developer network for additional documentation.I used material icons from Google Design for the navigation menu and Google Fonts for the font styles.
